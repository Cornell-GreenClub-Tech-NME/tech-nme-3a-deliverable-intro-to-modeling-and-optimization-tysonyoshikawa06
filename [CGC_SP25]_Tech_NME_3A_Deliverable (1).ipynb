For example, with Asphalt, linear programming may be used to optimize routes while keeping in mind constraints such as fuel, time, and overall feasibility (measured in some metric). More generally, this could be used for any subteam that requires buying/spending resources to drive sustainability and is limited by budget or time constraints."
